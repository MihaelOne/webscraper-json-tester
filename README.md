WebScraper JSON Tester

A lightweight Python tool for testing and validating WebScraper.io JSON sitemaps.

This script loads JSON sitemap files, extracts selectors, validates :contains() pseudo-class selectors, scrapes target URLs using BeautifulSoup, and outputs structured results into a CSV file.

Useful for:

verifying if sitemap selectors still work

debugging “not found” fields

validating large lists of scraped pages

preparing data for full-scale scraping automation
